# ðŸ§­ Ethical Guidelines for Web Crawling

Web crawling can be a powerful tool for gathering information, but it must be used responsibly. This document outlines the ethical principles to follow when building and running a web crawler.

## âœ… 1. Respect `robots.txt`

- Always check and obey the `robots.txt` file of a website.
- This file tells crawlers which paths should or shouldnâ€™t be accessed.
- Example: `https://example.com/robots.txt`

## âœ… 2. Use Rate Limiting

- Avoid sending too many requests in a short time.
- Introduce delays between requests (e.g., 1â€“2 seconds).
- This prevents server overload and reduces the risk of being banned.

## âœ… 3. Identify Your Crawler

- Always include a descriptive `User-Agent` string in your HTTP headers.
- Example:
  ```http
  User-Agent: MyCrawler/1.0 (+https://yourdomain.com/info)
## âœ… 5. Set Limits
 - Define a maximum crawl depth and a limit on the number of pages.
 - Restrict crawling to specific domains or subdomains.
 - Avoid infinite loops and unnecessary content.

## âœ… 6. Prevent Duplicate Requests
 - Track and skip URLs you've already visited.
 - This reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up crawling.

## âœ… Follow relevant data protection laws
 - GDPR
